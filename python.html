        <h3 style="text-align:center">Python</h3>

        <div>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readable syntax and broad ecosystem.
            It runs on all major platforms and is used for web development, automation, data science, and scripting at scale.</div><br>

        <h4>History</h4>
        <div>
          Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It was designed with readability and
          developer productivity in mind, drawing inspiration from ABC and other languages. Python 2 gained wide
          adoption in the 2000s, and Python 3 (released in 2008) introduced a cleaner, more consistent language
          design. The community completed the migration from Python 2 in 2020, consolidating modern development
          on Python 3.
        </div><br>
        <div>
          The Python Package Index (PyPI) and tools like pip helped make Python one of the most accessible ecosystems
          for libraries and applications. The language continues to evolve through regular releases with a strong
          emphasis on backward compatibility and performance improvements.
        </div><br>

        <h4>Usage and strengths</h4>
        <div>
          Python is popular for web development, data science, automation, scripting, and scientific computing.
          Its clean syntax makes it a common first language, while its libraries power production workloads in
          machine learning, data engineering, and cloud automation.
        </div><br>
        <div>
          Typical use cases include ETL pipelines, web APIs, data analysis notebooks, and developer tooling.
          Frameworks like Django and Flask are widely used, while libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn
          dominate the data ecosystem.
        </div><br>

        <h4>Current state and relevance</h4>
        <div>
          Python remains one of the most widely used languages in industry and education. It is a default choice
          for data-centric work and prototyping, with active maintenance and a large, supportive community.
          Performance has improved with each release, and tools such as type hints and linters make large codebases
          more maintainable.
        </div><br>
        <div>
          Is Python still relevant to learn? Yes. It is widely used in backend services, automation, and data
          workflows, and is often required for machine learning. Even when other languages are chosen for production
          performance, Python is frequently used for orchestration, research, and tooling.
        </div><br>

        <p>Here is an example of how to get a file list from an assigned directory recursively.</p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-python">
            import sys, shutil, os, re
    
            def list_file(root_dir):
    
              obj = []
    
              for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_dir):
                for file in files:
                    if file.endswith('.py') or file.endswith('.cgi') :
                    full_obj = os.path.join(root,file)
                    obj.append(full_obj)
    
              return obj
    
            def main():
              sRootDir = "/home/username"
              aFileList = list_file(sRootDir)
    
            if __name__ == '__main__':
              main()
            </code>
        </pre>
