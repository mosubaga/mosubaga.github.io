      <h2>Why Start Now?</h2>
      <p>Investing at a young age is one of the most powerful moves you can make. It's not just about having more money later; it's about having more <strong>options</strong>.</p>
      <p>When you start early, even small amounts can grow into something massive thanks to the magic of time.</p>

      <h2>⚠️ Let's Talk Risks</h2>
      <p>Investing isn't a guaranteed "get rich quick" scheme. There are real risks involved:</p>
      <p><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Prices go up, but they also go down. You could lose some of your initial investment.</p>
      <p><strong>Inflation Risk:</strong> If your money doesn't grow faster than prices rise, you're actually losing buying power.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Never invest money you might need for emergencies next month!</p>

      <h2>The Good News: Risks can be Managed! ✅</h2>
      <p>You don't have to be afraid. Risks can be managed and even avoided with the right approach. The key is <strong>Planning</strong>.</p>
      <p>By diversifying and thinking long-term, you can handle the bumps in the road. Remember the <strong>Risk and Return</strong> rule: higher potential returns usually come with higher risks. Finding your balance is the goal!</p>
