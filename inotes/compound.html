      <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
      <p>Compound interest is when you earn interest on your original money, AND on the interest you've already earned. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill, getting bigger and bigger as it goes!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why it's Crucial for YOU</h2>
      <p>Because you're young, you have the most valuable asset in the world: <strong>TIME</strong>. The longer you let your money compound, the more explosive the growth becomes in the later years.</p>
      <p>Starting at 15 instead of 25 can make a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time you retire!</p>

      <p>If they stop contributing and let it grow for 10 more years at 7%, it becomes about <strong>$359,980</strong>.</p>
      <p>If they keep contributing $150 per month for those extra 10 years, the total is about <strong>$393,722</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A 30-year-old invests $200 per month for 25 years at a 9% annual return. Total after 25 years: about <strong>$224,224</strong>.</p>
      <p>If they stop contributing and let it grow for 10 more years at 9%, it becomes about <strong>$530,821</strong>.</p>
      <p>If they keep contributing $200 per month for those extra 10 years, the total is about <strong>$588,357</strong>.</p>
