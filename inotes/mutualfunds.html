      <h2>Understanding Mutual Funds</h2>
      <p>Mutual funds are similar to ETFs because they hold many different investments. However, they are often "actively managed," meaning a professional fund manager is picking which stocks or bonds to buy and sell to try and beat the market.</p>

      <h2>Are they right for you?</h2>
      <p>Mutual funds can be great if you want a professional to handle the heavy lifting, but watch out for those fees! High fees can eat into your profits over time.</p>

      <h2>Active vs Index Funds</h2>
      <p>Active funds try to beat the market by picking winners. Index funds just follow the market and usually cost less.</p>
      <p>If two funds look similar, the lower-fee option often wins over the long run.</p>
