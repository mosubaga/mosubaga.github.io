                Probability is a branch in mathematics on how likely an event is to occur. Most probalilities are expressed as fractions, decimal numbers or percentages and are measured on a scaled between zero and one. If an event is impossible to occur, the probability is 0. A certain event has a probability of 1. Calculating permutations and combinations are essential on finding probabilities of an event.

                In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) is already known to have occurred. This particular method relies on event A occurring with some sort of relationship with another event B. This can be written by :

            <span class="math display">\[ P(A \lvert B) = \frac{P(B \lvert A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]</span>

                <h4>Monty Hall Problem — Bayes' Theorem Explanation</h4>
                <p>
                    The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario with three doors.
                    You pick one door; the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat; then
                    you are offered the choice to stay with your original door or switch to the remaining closed door.
                </p>
                <h2>Summary answer</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="boxed">
                  If you <em>switch</em> after the host opens a goat door, your probability of winning the car is <em>2/3</em>.<br>
                  If you <em>stay</em> with your original choice, your probability is <em>1/3</em>.
                </div>
                <br

                <h2>Formal derivation with Bayes' theorem</h2>
                <p>Notation (label the doors 1, 2, 3). Suppose you initially choose door 1. Define events:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A<sub>1</sub> = "the car is behind door 1"</li>
                    <li>A<sub>2</sub> = "the car is behind door 2"</li>
                    <li>A<sub>3</sub> = "the car is behind door 3"</li>
                    <li>B = "the host opens door 3" (revealing a goat)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We want the posterior probabilities P(A<sub>i</sub> | B). Bayes' theorem says</p>
                <pre class="math">P(A_i | B) = P(B | A_i) * P(A_i) / P(B)</pre>

                <p>Start with the priors (before the host opens any door):</p>
                <pre class="math">P(A1) = P(A2) = P(A3) = 1/3</pre>

                <p>Compute the likelihoods P(B | A<sub>i</sub>) — the chance the host opens door 3 given where the car actually is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>If the car is behind door 1 (A<sub>1</sub>)</strong>: then the host must open either door 2 or door 3. If the host chooses uniformly at random between the two goat doors, the probability he opens door 3 is <code>1/2</code>. So <code>P(B | A1) = 1/2</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>If the car is behind door 2 (A<sub>2</sub>)</strong>: the host cannot open door 2 (it has the car) and must open door 3 (the only goat door left). So <code>P(B | A2) = 1</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>If the car is behind door 3 (A<sub>3</sub>)</strong>: the host will not open door 3 because it hides the car. So <code>P(B | A3) = 0</code>.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Compute the total probability P(B) by the law of total probability:</p>
                <pre class="math">P(B) = Σ_i P(B | A_i) P(A_i) = (1/2)*(1/3) + 1*(1/3) + 0*(1/3) = 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2</pre>

                <p>Now apply Bayes' theorem to get the posteriors.</p>
                <pre class="math">P(A1 | B) = (P(B | A1) * P(A1)) / P(B) = (1/2 * 1/3) / (1/2) = (1/6) / (1/2) = 1/3</pre>

                <pre class="math">P(A2 | B) = (P(B | A2) * P(A2)) / P(B) = (1 * 1/3) / (1/2) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3</pre>

                <pre class="math">P(A3 | B) = 0</pre>

                <p>Interpretation: after the host opens door 3, the probability the car is behind your original choice (door 1) is still <strong>1/3</strong>, and the probability it is behind the other unopened door (door 2) is <strong>2/3</strong>. So switching doubles your chance of winning.</p>

                <h2>Short intuitive explanation</h2>
                <p>
                    When you first pick a door you have a 1/3 chance of being right and a 2/3 chance of being wrong. The host's action of opening a goat door does not change the initial 1/3 chance your chosen door had — instead it concentrates the original 2/3 probability of "car is not behind your door" onto the single unopened door the host left. Thus switching wins with probability 2/3.
                </p>

                <h2>Generalization to n doors</h2>
                <p>With <em>n</em> doors, you pick one (probability 1/n of being correct). The host — who knows where the prize is — opens <em>n−2</em> goat doors, leaving one other closed door. If the host always avoids the prize and never opens your picked door, switching to the single remaining closed door yields probability (n−1)/n of winning (because the initial 1/n chance you picked correctly remains with your original door, and the complementary (n−1)/n probability transfers to the other unopened door).</p>
