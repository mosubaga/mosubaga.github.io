#### A code in Python that will unzip multiple zip files asynchronously.

```python
import asyncio
import zipfile

async def unzip_file(zip_path, extract_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(extract_path)

async def unzip_all_files(zip_paths, extract_path):
    tasks = [unzip_file(zip_path, extract_path) for zip_path in zip_paths]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

async def main():
    zip_paths = ['file1.zip', 'file2.zip', 'file3.zip']
    extract_path = 'output/'

    await unzip_all_files(zip_paths, extract_path)
    print("All files extracted successfully.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

```

#### A code in Python that uses a thread module to read multiple files.

```python
import threading

# Function to read a file and store its contents in a list
def read_file(file_path, results):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            results[file_path] = content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        results[file_path] = "File not found"

# List of file paths to read
file_paths = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

# Dictionary to store results
results = {}

# Create a thread for each file
threads = []
for file_path in file_paths:
    thread = threading.Thread(target=read_file, args=(file_path, results))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

# Print the contents of each file
for file_path, content in results.items():
    print(f"File: {file_path}")
    print(content)
    print()
```
